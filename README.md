# The GNES Library for Kubernetes

Launch `GNES` on Kubernetes using [Kubernetes Helm](https://github.com/helm/helm).


## Before you begin

### Setup a Kubernetes Cluster

### Install Helm

Helm is a tool for managing Kubernetes charts. Charts are packages of pre-configured Kubernetes resources.

To install Helm, refer to the [Helm install guide](https://github.com/helm/helm#install) and ensure that the `helm` binary is in the `PATH` of your shell.


### Using Helm

Once you have installed the Helm client and initialized the Tiller server, you can deploy a GNES Helm Chart into a Kubernetes cluster.

Please refer to the [Quick Start guide](https://github.com/helm/helm/blob/master/docs/quickstart.md) if you wish to get running in just a few commands, otherwise the [Using Helm Guide](https://github.com/helm/helm/blob/master/docs/using_helm.md) provides detailed instructions on how to use the Helm client to manage packages on your Kubernetes cluster.

Useful Helm Client Commands:
* View available charts: `helm search`
* Install a chart: `helm install stable/<package-name>`
* Upgrade your application: `helm upgrade`
